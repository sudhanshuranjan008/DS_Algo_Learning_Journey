# DS_Algo_Learning_Journey

## About
This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It includes problem-solving approaches, implementation techniques, and explanations of various DSA concepts.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **Arrays**: Basic and advanced array problems.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Stack-based problems and queue operations.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, and more.
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, and graph-based problems.
- **Sorting & Searching**: Implementations of algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Classic DP problems and techniques.

## Purpose
- Strengthen my problem-solving skills.
- Document and track my learning progress.
- Provide a reference for others interested in DSA.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary language for implementing algorithms and solving problems.
