ðŸ“š DSA & Algorithms
Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) repository! This is a collection of algorithms and data structures Iâ€™m learning, practicing, and improving on. I am focusing on enhancing my problem-solving abilities, improving code efficiency, and preparing for technical interviews and job opportunities in Data Engineering and Python Development.

ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts Covered:
In this repository, I am working on a variety of algorithms and data structures, including:

Sorting Algorithms: QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort, etc.
Searching Algorithms: Binary Search, Linear Search.
Linked Lists: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, etc.
Stacks & Queues: Implementation using arrays/linked lists.
Trees: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.
Greedy Algorithms: Activity Selection, Job Sequencing, etc.

ðŸŒ± Current Focus:
Problem-Solving & Optimization: Solving problems from LeetCode, HackerRank, and InterviewBit to solidify my understanding of algorithms.
Big-O Complexity: Focusing on time and space optimization of algorithms to be interview-ready.

ðŸš€ Goals:
Master DSA for technical interviews.
Implement complex algorithms and improve code efficiency.
Learn new data structures and practice solving more advanced problems.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary language for implementing algorithms and solving problems.
